# Daily Code Challenges

This repository serves the purpose of holding different files that are solutions (or partial solutions) to different coding challenges.

The challenges are taken from https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/ and some other places. The code is written in different languages in order to be diverse and interesting. Every day, there will be a new solution pushed to the repository.

> *Note* - These solutions are neither optimal nor always complete. The idea is to constantly code and experiment with new languages, systems, techniques, i.e. to write some code every day and to progress.
